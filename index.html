<div id="Aristotle">
  <center><h1 style=color:white;>Aristotle and the Greeks and their beliefs</h1></center>
  <center><h2 style=color:white;>On 360 BC I remember the day the Greece born Aristotle proved his theory about how all planets are spherical. It was a great day for Astronomy. Back then, Aristotle believed in the Geocentric model of the universe. He thought that earth was being revolved around by everything. According to him, the Sun, planets, and stars were located in spheres that revolved around the Earth.</h2></center>

<div id="Ptolemy">
  <center><h1 style=color:white;>Ptolemy and his beliefs</h1></center>
  <center><h2 style=color:white;>I remember Ptolemy well, he was a great man. I met him in egypt, his homeland, around 150 AD. Ptolemy came up with the geocentric model. The model that states the Earth is the center of the universe. He also believed that the circle in which planets theoretically revolved around us, was a perfect circle. We can understand from common day knowledge that this theory was false. But good old Ptolemy believed greatly in his theory so he created the first actual model with the Earth as the center of the universe.

  </div>
  <div id="Copernicus">
    <center><h1 style="color:white;">Copernicus and his beliefs</h1></center>
    <center><h2 style="color:white;">Now Copernicus was one smart man from Poland. He didn't think that it was logical for the earth to be in the center of the universe. Instead he thought that maybe the planets revolved around the sun. At first it did not seem realistic because everyone was stuck on the idea of a geocentric universe. So when Copernicus proposed the idea for the helio centric model,people thought he was crazy. It was only after many years to come did people not think of him as insane. Which was about around the year 1512. </h2></center>

  <div id="Tycho">
    <center><h1 style="color:white;">Tycho Brahe and his contributions.</h1></center>
    <center><h2 style="color:white;">Tycho Brahe made a very important contribution to Astronomy. It was because of him that people started to believe in the heliocentric model. Now Tycho was definitely passionate about his feelings toward studying the cosmos. He lost his nose in a sword fight  with his third cousin over a mathematical formula. So, he glued many precious metals to his face to make up for his lost nose. The king of Sweden knew about Tycho's love for astronomy so he granted Tycho and island where he could conduct his studies further. During 1580 is when Tycho started to get more and more astronomers to come to his island for research. It was a beautiful island. I remember it well.</h2> </center>

  <div id="Johannes">
    <center><h1 style="color:white;">Johannes Kepler and his contributions</h1></center>
    <center><h2 style="color:white;">Johannes was a smart man. Because of him, we are able to understand planetary motion better. 1619 was when he finished his three laws of planetary motion. (1) the planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus; (2) the time necessary to traverse any arc of a planetary orbit is proportional to the area of the sector between the central body and that arc (the “area law”); and (3) there is an exact relationship between the squares of the planet's’ periodic times and the cubes of the radii of their orbits (the “harmonic law”). -Kepler.

    <center><h2 style="color:white;">Have you ever heard the story about Isaac Newton watching an apple fall from his apple tree? Well that gave him the inspiration and creativity to create the three laws of motion. In 1666 they were created. These three laws have helped humanity discover so many new technologies. Especially the rocket. </h2></center>

It was a monumental leap for mankind the day that the first rocket was launched because we finally knew that we could actually go into space and explore more. America then started to build rockets to compete with the german ones. They wanted to have the best technology. This also started a new chapter in the world of physics.</h2></center>

Everyone thought he was insane and this was impossible. America was very bad at creating rockets at the time and during that period people thought JFK was out of his mind. NASA started getting to work on a rocket that would safely bring astronauts to the moon and back. They started out with three major projects which will be explained later in the website.</h2></center>

Project Gemini was completed in 1966 with the goal to connect two different spaceships in space. This was necessary for landing on the moon. The final step was project Apollo with the objective of landing on the moon, collecting samples and making it safely back to earth.</h2></center>

The reason the Apollo missions stopped was because NASA simply did not have the time or money to continue them. One of the most dangerous Apollo missions was Apollo 13 where there was an explosion in one of the oxygen tanks that forced the crew to come back to earth without landing on the moon. The failed mission went through the following dates: Apr 11, 1970 – Apr 17, 1970</h2></center>

One of the main goals of the rover was to look for evidence of life or ancient life. Very recently the element, Boron, was found on mars. Which makes this finding so significant is that that's an essential ingredient for life. </h2></center>
